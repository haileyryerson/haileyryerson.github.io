      <description>Note to the readers: this analysis was done during the week of March 29th rankings.
With weeks away from the first serve, 48 teams will travel to the midwest as Omaha, Nebraska will host the entire tournament. The tournament will take place at CHI Health Center from April 14-24. Covid-19 cancellations or poseponents have played a big factor in this unique season.
All eyes are on the Big Ten schools, as anyone of them could walk away with the trophy.</description>
